# chatbot
This project is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python and the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. It uses basic pattern matching and pre-defined responses to interact with users. The chatbot can handle common conversational inputs such as greetings, simple queries, jokes, and more.
Chatbot using NLTK
A simple rule-based chatbot created using Python and the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library. The chatbot can respond to various inputs like greetings, basic questions, jokes, and more. It's designed to demonstrate basic natural language processing techniques and simple pattern matching.

Features
Responds to greetings like "Hi", "Hello", "Hey".
Provides simple responses to questions like "How are you?", "What is your name?".
Tells jokes when asked.
Responds to "Thank you" or "Thanks".
Handles "bye" and ends the conversation gracefully.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Make sure Python is installed on your system.
NLTK library: This project uses the NLTK library to process user input and generate responses.
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
2. Install Dependencies
You need to install the necessary Python libraries to run the chatbot. The NLTK library is required.

To install dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk
3. Download NLTK Data
The chatbot requires NLTK's punkt tokenizer. It is automatically downloaded when the chatbot is run for the first time. However, you can manually download it by running the following in a Python shell:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
Usage
After setting up the project, run the chatbot.py file in your terminal:
bash
Copy code
python chatbot.py
The chatbot will start in the terminal, and you can interact with it by typing messages.
Example interaction:

vbnet
Copy code
ChatBot: Hi! I am a chatbot. Type 'bye' to exit.
You: hello
ChatBot: Hi there!
You: Tell me a joke
ChatBot: Why don’t skeletons fight each other? They don’t have the guts!
You: bye
ChatBot: Goodbye!
Commands
Type hello, hi, or hey to greet the chatbot.
Ask How are you? or What is your name? to get a response.
Type tell me a joke to hear a joke.
Type bye to end the conversation.
Code Structure
chatbot.py: The main script containing the chatbot's logic.
patterns_responses: A list of regular expressions and responses for the chatbot.
start_chat(): The function to start the chatbot and handle user interaction.
Troubleshooting
NLTK Library Not Found: If you get an error like ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'nltk', make sure you have installed NLTK using:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk
Chatbot Not Responding Correctly: The chatbot uses regular expressions to match user inputs. If it doesn't respond correctly, you might need to update the patterns and responses in patterns_responses to add more variations of user inputs.
